Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

**What you will learn:**

- How the Markdown format makes styled collaborative editing easy
- How Markdown differs from traditional formatting approaches
- How to use Markdown to format text
- How to leverage GitHub’s automatic Markdown rendering
- How to apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

## Examples

### Text

```md
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown, also ~~delete any words~~. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

### Lists

```md
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
```

### Images

```md
If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

### Headers & Quotes

```md
# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> -- Captain Janeway
```

### Code

``````md
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### Table

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```md
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

### Task Lists

I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
